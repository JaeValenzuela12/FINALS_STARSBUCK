            "Our mission at Starbucks is to cherish the moments that emanate from each cup, moments that touch the heart, alongside every community. We believe in the infinite possibilities created by connections between people, and we nurture them."</h3>
            <p>Starbucks has always held our mission dear, engaging sincerely with the customers in front of us through a cup of coffee, exchanging words and hearts. We have embraced the essence of each era, whether it's the lifestyle of strolling the streets with a paper cup or tumbler in hand, or the proposition of a 'third place' beyond home and work, to continually sense the pulse of the times, create new value, and cultivate culture.
                Moving forward, we will continue to deliver heartwarming moments that seamlessly blend into each customer's life, while positively impacting communities and valuing humanity. We will persist in further challenges, always treasuring what it means to be human.</p>
